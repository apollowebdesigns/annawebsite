        Contemporary Handmade Jewellery
        I'm a designer/ maker who enjoys working in delicate silver wire and resin. My interest in working with metals developed while studying Textile Design at Nottingham Trent University. Specialising in embroidery in my final year, I was looking for ways to make my work more sculptural. Working with fine wire to make lace-like structures became my solution and continues to influence my making process.
        In the years since graduating I have developed and refined my metalsmithing skills and enjoy experimenting with new materials and processes. Newest pieces of my work combine sterling silver and epoxy resin. The collection involves a combination of moulded and free-form processes. Using multiple layering techniques I suspend tiny silver elements made from resin, inside a resin shell. I make in small batches of no more than 10 of each design.
        Many of the techinques I use were discovered while experiementing and testing the possibilties of my materials. It is important to me to find processes which allow for improvisation and spontaneity. I like working with wire because I can use my fingers to shape it - directly transferring the energy that motivates me into the metal. It feels like drawing, the wire is soft and responsive, producing instant and sensitive results.
        I love the smoothness and the possibilities for altering the colour, form and opacity of resin. I enjoy its freeform properties - the way it can be manipulated before it sets to create one-off formations. I am interested in capturing movment of colour through the resin and keeping the patterns which form as I mix colours.
        Emotions inspire my work, the creative process feels quite personal and I tend to be reflective while I'm making. I aim to capture mood and am drawn to colours and textures which support this mood. I work tonally using quiet colour combinations and subtle changes in texture. Ideas are formed around the landscape and the ways in which it can mirror or influence emotion. When I see something beautiful in nature I am moved to try to capture it in some way, to create an impression of how it felt to be in that moment.
